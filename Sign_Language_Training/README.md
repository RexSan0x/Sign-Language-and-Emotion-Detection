# Sign Language Detection
The sign language detection model is designed to identify American character sign language from an input image and provide corresponding character predictions. It leverages the power of MediaPipe, a popular library for hand tracking and landmark detection, to accurately detect and track hand movements. The hand landmarks extracted from the detected hand region are then used as input for a Random Forest classifier, which makes the final sign language prediction.

This folder contains the following files:
  * **create_img.py**: This python file is used to create image Dataset for training the model. It captures images of every American hand signs from users camera using OpenCV, and stores it this directory.
  * **create_dataset.py**: This python file takes the Image dataset, formed from the `create_img.py` and finds the landmarks of the hand regions from all these images, and stores them in a pickle file.
  * **train_classifier.py**: This python file is used to train our Random-Forest Classifier with the landmark dataset, obtained by running `create_dataset.py`.
  * **inference_sign_lang.py**: This python file allows us to capture the user camera feed in real time, and preddict the hand sign using the Trained Random Forest Classifier model.

## Setup

1. Python version used - `3.8.16`
2. Camera is required from the user's end
3. All python libraries used for this project can be installed using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

##  Training the Classifier

1. Clone the repository by running the command: <br> `git clone https://github.com/RexSan0x/Sign-Language-and-Emotion-Detection.git`
2. Change your current working directory to the cloned repository. Navigate to the **Sign_Language_Training** folder using the command: <br>`cd Sign-Language-and-Emotion-Detection/Sign_Language_Training/`
3. Install all the required libraries for the application by running the following command:<br> `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Make a new Directory **Data** for storing the Images of all Handsigns of 26 alphabets. Run the command to make the new Directory: <br>`mkdir Data`
5. Run the python file **create_img.py** using the command <br>`python create_img.py` <br>This file creates the Image Dataset for all hand signs of 26 alphabets for both right and left hand.
6. After all the Images of Hand signs are saved, run the file **create_dataset.py** using command <br>`python create_dataset.py`<br>This will find all the hand landmarks from the image and store it in a pickle file - **data2.pickle**
7. Run the python file **train_classifier.py**, using the command - <br>`python train_classifier.py`<br>This file will train the Random Forest classifier with hand landmark data, and svae the model as **model2.p**

## Testing the Classifier

1. For getting the trained classifier, the user can either download the pre-trained model from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l_q19HCCZnYOhTUors5LkYavlr-CWliQ/view?usp=drive_link) and save it in this directory with the name **model2.p** or follow the instruction above from **Training the Classifier**.
2. After adding the trained classifier, run the python file **inferece_sign_lang.py** using the command:<br>`python inferece_sign_lang.py`<br>This python file takes real time video frames from the users camera and predicts the hand sign of the user hand using this trained model.
